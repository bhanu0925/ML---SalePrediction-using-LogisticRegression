# ML- SalePrediction-using-LogisticRegression

### Steps carried to solve the usecase
     1. The problem - > To predict weather the new customer will buy certain product or not
     2. Collecting Data set -> In this usecase, bsed on age and salary, predicting will purchase or will not purchase
     3. Load and summerise the data sets
     4. Segragate the date in to X and y depending on independent and dependent variable,Purchase is dependent variable here
     5. Splitting dataset in to train and test
     6. Feature scalling to mainitain the scare of futute to avaoid higher weightage on single feature, to avoiding biasing
             Can be achieved by Normalization
                                Standardization
     7. Algorithm - Logistic Regression - > output -> binary
     8. Training -> training the model with preprocessed dataset
     9. Validation -> using confusion matrix
     10. PRediction -> observe hoe the model is performing in new data.
